Pictin is an application used to generate many kinds of measurements pertaining to the analysis of human body X-rays. It
offers functionalities such as rotation, scale, zoom, measurement of angles and distances, as well as the drawing of
primitive shapes. Furthermore, it has an undo/redo function for instances where an error was made. Finally, the application 
contains several step-by-step processes designed to guide the user in the measurement of values specific to certain parts of the body.

My contributions:

- All tools except the modification of contrast and brightness
- Undo/Redo
- All step-by-step processes

Experience gained:

- Linear algebra
- Interface and application state management
- Javascript

I unfortunately cannot give public access to the code, but am more than happy to demo the application to any potential 
employer.

This application is used to calculate the number of collisions between patient visits in an hospital. The constaints
for a collision are arbitrarily defined by the user. The focus of the project was mainly put on the performance and 
scaling of the algorithm, which forced me to consider its memory footprint as well as its computational efficiency.<br/>


Experience gained:

- Model-View-Controller architecture
- Performance based requirements; optimization of an algorithm used to generate visit-combinations permutations
- Design patterns : Observer, Facade, Bridge
- Unit testing
- C#; .NET

This is a grocery store simulation that models the flow of customers according to different parameters, such as the number
of items bought and the time of arrival. The project's focus was on design patterns as well as flexibility through proper
abstraction. Furthermore, traceability between requirements, design, and code was strongly enforced.<br/>


Experience gained:

- Model-View-Controller architecture
- Design patterns : Strategy, Facade, Observer, Singleton, Bridge
- C#; .NET
